1. Dowload all the files and put them under the same directory
2. Check the line 56 in app_p1.py to see if you need to change the path of the ads cookbook pdf file
3. Get the api key from 'https://platform.openai.com/'. Replace it with your own key in the 10th line of app_p1.py, as well as in the .env file. [Can't use my key bc my key will be disabled soon if shared on the github]

5. Run the app_p1.py in terminal
6. Ask several questions like 'What is ads?', 'Summarize the ads cookbook pdf' etc., and do the filming.
   You could skip the explanation of code bc I've already filmed it. Finally, upload your video to the drive.
